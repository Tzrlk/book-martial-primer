==== Associate
Some individuals wish to assist the Order of the Wolf with their endeavours, but do not wish to commit themselves with
the dedication required of an Oathed member. Such people are ranked as associates, and will defer to the expertise of
any and all Oathed members.

An associate should never be given command over an Oathed member unless circumstances are dire enough that it becomes
critically necessary for effective operations.
